  // You are to implement something like the following

  // The linked list data structure results from reading in
  // the user's input.

  Print 'Welcome to OurScheme!'

        )

  Print '\n'
  Print 'Thanks for using OurScheme!' // Doesn't matter whether there is an

2. Syntax of OurScheme

terminal :
  LEFT-PAREN       // '('
  RIGHT-PAREN      // ')'
  INT              // e.g., '123', '+123', '-123'
  STRING           // "string's (example)." (strings do not extend across lines)
  DOT              // '.'
  FLOAT            // '123.567', '123.', '.567', '+123.4', '-.123'
  NIL              // 'nil' or '#f', but not 'NIL' nor 'nIL'
  T                // 't' or '#t', but not 'T' nor '#T'
  QUOTE            // '
  SYMBOL           // a consecutive sequence of printable characters that are
                   // not numbers, and do not contain '(', ')', single-quote,
                   // double-quote and white-spaces ; 
                   // Symbols are case-sensitive 
                   // (i.e., uppercase and lowercase are different);

Note :

  With the exception of strings, token are separated by the following "separators" :
    (a) one or more white-spaces
    (b) '('                               (note : '(' is a token by itself)
    (c) ')'                               (note : ')' is a token by itself)
    (d) the single-quote character (')    (note : it is a token by itself)
    (e) the double-quote character (")    (note : it starts a STRING)

Examples :

  '3.25' is a FLOAT.
  '3.25a' is a SYMBOL.
  'a.b' is a SYMBOL.
  '#f' is NIL
  '#fa' (alternatively, 'a#f') is a SYMBOL.

Note :

  '.' can mean several things : 
    it is either part of a FLOAT or part of a SYMBOL or a DOT.
    
  It means a DOT only when it "stands alone".
  
  '#' can also mean two things :
    it is either part of NIL (or T) or part of a SYMBOL.
  
  It is part of NIL (or T) only when it is '#t' or '#f' that "stand alone".
  
<S-exp> ::= <ATOM> 
            | LEFT-PAREN <S-exp> { <S-exp> } [ DOT <S-exp> ] RIGHT-PAREN
            | QUOTE <S-exp>
            
<ATOM>  ::= SYMBOL | INT | FLOAT | STRING 
            | NIL | T | LEFT-PAREN RIGHT-PAREN

Once the attempt to read in an S-expression fails, the line 
containing the error-char is ignored.  Start to read in an 
S-expression from the next input line.

Note : a quoted S-expression '... is the same as (quote ...)

   a. In C, the basic program building block is a statement.
      In OurScheme, the basic program building block is 
      an S-expression (S-exp, for short).
      
   b. An S-exp is either an atom, a list, or a dotted pair.
   
   c. An atom is either an integer (e.g., 123), a float
      (e.g., 12.34 or 12. or .34), a string (e.g., "Hi, there!"), 
      or a symbol (e.g., abc).
      
   d. Abc, abc, aBc, a-B!c?, !??, t, nil are examples of symbols
   
      // Blanks and line-returns ("white-space characters") are 
      // considered delimiters
      
      // Upper case and lower case are different, e.g., aB, AB, Ab,
      // ab are all different symbols.
      
      // Each symbol may or may not be bound to an S-exp.
      
      // When I say that a symbol abc is bound to the S-exp
      // (abc "Hi there" (5 3)),
      // you could take what I mean to be that the "value" of abc
      // is (abc "Hi there" (5 3)).
      
      // "Binding" (rather than "value") is a better way of saying 
      // what the situation really is.  
      
      // t, nil are two system-defined symbols 
      //   (t for "true" and nil for "false")
      // They cannot be bound to any S-exp (i.e., they cannot be 
      // treated like user-defined symbols and cannot have values).
      
      // t is also written as #t, meaning "true"
      // nil is also written as () or #f, meaning "false"
      // In other word,
      //   these two are the same : t   #t
      //   these three are the same : nil   #f   ()
      
      // OurScheme understands both 't' and '#t', but it only prints '#t'
      // OurScheme understands all these three : 'nil', '#f', '()',
      //   but it only prints 'nil'.     
      
      // Side remark :
      //   (True) Scheme uses #t, #f and ()
      //   "Other Lisps" use t, nil and ()
      
   e. An �uS-exp sequence�v is of the form
         S1 S2 S3 ... Sn
      where each Si is an S-exp.
      // e.g., (1) 1 (1 . 1)
      // e.g., 1 2 (3 4 (5))
      // Each of the above S-exp sequence contains three S-exp

   f. A dotted pair is of the form
        (SS1 . S2)
      where S2 is an S-exp, whereas SS1 is an �uS-exp sequence�v.
      // Note that there is a dot between SS1 and S2,
      //      with one or more spaces in between
      // e.g., (1 . 2)
      // e.g., (1  2  3  4  . 5)
      // e.g., (1  2  3  4  . ())
      // e.g., (1 . (2 . (3 . abc)))
      // e.g., (1 2 3 . abc)
      // e.g., ((1) (2 (3)) . (abc))
      // e.g., ((1) (2 (3)) . (nil))
      // e.g., ((1) (2 (3)) . nil)
      
   g. The following notations of dotted pairs are equivalent.
      
      (S1 S2 S3 S4 . S5)
      (S1 . (S2 . (S3 . (S4 . S5))))
      
   h. Comment :
      What we refer to as a "dotted pair" is different from what
      other professionals refer to as a "dotted pair".
      
      What other professionals mean by a dotted pair is just
      (S1 . S2), where S1 and S2 are S-exp.
      
   i. A list is of the form
        (SS1)
      where SS1 is an �uS-exp sequence�v.
      // Note : () is known as "the empty list"
      // For historical reasons, () is defined to be the same
      //   as nil or #f, meaning "false"
      
   j. A list (S1 S2 ... Sn) is actually a short-handed
      notation for the following dotted pair
        (S1 . (S2 . (...(Sn . nil)))...)))
      In other words, a list is actually a special kind of
      dotted pair.
      
      Another way of writing the list (S1 S2 ... Sn) is
        (S1 S2 ... Sn . nil)
        
      // In other word, there are three (seven?) ways for writing
      // the same list.
      //   (S1 S2 S3 S4 S5)
      //   (S1 . (S2 . (S3 . (S4 . (S5 . nil)))))
      //   (S1 . (S2 . (S3 . (S4 . (S5 . #f )))))
      //   (S1 . (S2 . (S3 . (S4 . (S5 . () )))))
      //   (S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 . nil)
      //   (S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 . #f)
      //   (S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 . ())
        
   k. When the system prints out a dotted pair, it
      always tries to print it in list-like format.
      
      For example, if the dotted pair is
        (1 . (2 . (3 . (4 . 5))))
      Then the system prints it as
        (1 2 3 4 . 5)
        
      But if the dotted pair is
        (1 . (2 . (3 . (4 . nil))))
      The system does not print it as
        (1 2 3 4 . nil)
      Instead, the system prints it as
        (1 2 3 4)
   
   l. Line comments
   
   A line comment begins with ';' until the end-of-line.
   This ';' must be such that either it is the very first 
   character of the line or there is a separater preceding this ';'
   on this line. 
   
   (Therefore, for example, 'ab;b' is a symbol,
    while 'ab ;b' is the symbol 'ab' followed by a 
    line comment that starts with ';b'.)
        
3. Here are some examples of what your program should
   do for project 1. (The following assumes that your program
   runs interactively.)

   It is an error.  (Let us suppose that it is '> .$', where '$' is
   LINE-ENTER char.)

   column : 2   '.' is the very first user input char
                on this line.  (the space before it is system output)

   Why column 2 and not column 1? Please see my answer to your second

   question below. (The system detects an error when it sees the LINE-

   ENTER char.)

In the case of (the first one) '(12(. 3))', everything is still

OK when the system (i.e., your system) "sees" '.'.  Why?  Because '.'

may be followed by a digit such as '5'.  The system detects an error

only when it sees that there is a space following '.'.  Therefore, the

"error char" (the char that caused the error) is the space and not the '.'


In the case of (the second one) '(12 (    . 3))', the error char should

also be the space-char following that '.'   You just found an error in my

Project 1 handout.  Thank you.  (And I have taken the liberty to

correct this error in both OurSchemeProj1.txt and HowToWriteOurScheme.doc)


> 3.�а�abc"abc�|�L�X����O???

  The first token is 'abc'. The second token is a string that starts

  with : "abc

  e.g., // for project 1

  > abc"abc   "
  abc

  > "abc   "
